<TimeLineElement title="ML 101 Sessions - 29th Dec 2024, 2nd and 4th Jan 2025">
      Participants, especially Begineer Pioneers are strongly encouraged to attend the mentoring sessions. These sessions will provide in-depth guidance, explaining key concepts from scratch and offering one-on-one support during the model development phase. Join us at <a href="https://meet.google.com/xwr-wqyc-ssj" target="_blank" class="text-accent">meet.google.com/xwr-wqyc-ssj</a>
    </TimeLineElement>
    <TimeLineElement title="Release of Train data - 2nd Jan 2025">
      A 3k row labeled training dataset will be released along with the detailed problem statement, milestones and information on evaluation metrics. Teams can start exploring the dataset, build & train suitable models. External datasets CANNOT be used in the competition.
    </TimeLineElement>
    <TimeLineElement title="Release of Labeled development set - 2nd Jan 2025">
A development set containing 1k new samples will be provided for model evaluation. Participants can use this set to test their model-generated values against the actual data, using metrics like ROUGE-L and BLEU scores to assess performance and select the best model or further optimise and fine-tune their model's hyperparameters.
</TimeLineElement>
    <TimeLineElement title="Release of Unlabeled Test set & Submission of Deliverables - 4th to 5th Jan 2025 10.00 IST">
      Teams will use their best-performing model to generate predictions for an unlabeled (ground truth values are not revealed) test set. Each team is allowed to submit one run, which should include the predictions (in .csv format) generated by their model and working code (in .ipynb format) that can be used to reproduce their results.
    </TimeLineElement>
    <TimeLineElement title="App-deployment & Presentation - 6th Jan 2025">
      Here's a twist. There will be another surprise test set which will features content that is significantly different in style, genre, or domain of the other sets - this challenges participants to handle more generalization, adaptability and robustness. The top-performing teams will proceed to a final round where they will deploy their model and deliver a presentation. Evaluation will consider model performance, novelty, techniques used, and overall presentation quality.

<li>Participants registered for LogicLooM will be allowed to attend the sessions.</li>
<li>Participants must join the Google Meet session using their official student email ID to ensure their attendance is recorded. GMeet links will be shared in advance with registered participants.</li>
<li>While the sessions will also be live-streamed on the Paradox official YouTube channel, joining the GMeet session is compulsory to be considered an official participant.</li>
<li>A Q&A feature will be available after each talk to address participant queries. To facilitate this, a form for submitting questions will be shared a day before each session. Questions submitted via the form will be addressed during the session.</li>
