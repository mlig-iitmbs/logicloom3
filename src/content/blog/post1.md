After the incredible success of our inaugural event at Paradox in Margazhi '23, we took things to the next level with an exciting new edition focused on programming, AI, and ML. Open to students of all levels, this time we welcomed over 600 participants on campus, all eager to compete for a prize pool of 15K! The event was a whirlwind of mind-bending challenges designed to test not just technical skills, but also creativity and critical thinking. Participants pushed the limits of problem-solving, thinking outside the box and breaking through the boundaries of conventional wisdom. It was an inspiring and electrifying experience, where innovation and collaboration took center stage.

## The Learning Curve

At Logicloom, we had the honor of hosting a truly inspiring participant, Ms. Sasikala Balasubramanium, a 65-year-old student from IITM BS. Passionate about Mathematics and Statistics, Ms. Sasikala B's journey is a powerful testament to the idea that itâ€™s never too late to pursue your dreams and learn something new.
She shared how IITM BS reignited her passion for learning, giving her the courage to return to academics after 42 years. For her, events like Logicloom are crucial as they provide beginners with a significant learning curve. She particularly appreciated the creative round, which sparked deep reflection and encouraged engaging discussions with herself. Ms. Sasikala remarked that it was through events like Logicloom that she was able to relive her younger days at campus, recalling fond memories of the OAT and the temples she used to visit.

What truly stood out to us during our conversation was her incredible confidence, radiant personality, and grace. Her beautiful saree added to her charm, but it was her spirit that left a lasting impression. Ms. Sasikala's story serves as an inspiring reminder that age is no barrier to learning and growth. She encouraged all of us, saying, "If I can study AI at my age, you can certainly rock it at yours!"

Her journey is a beacon of motivation for all of us, showing that the pursuit of knowledge and passion can continue at any stage of life. Ms. Sasikala has truly inspired us, and we are certain her story will resonate with all future participants to come.
