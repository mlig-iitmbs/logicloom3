We kicked off the event with a thought-provoking warm-up round that blended coding logic with aptitude challenges. It was the perfect icebreaker to get our participants thinking critically and preparing them for the journey ahead. But that was just the beginning! 
The subsequent rounds were team-based, with groups of four coming together to tackle AI and ML challenges. This format not only sparked collaboration but also fostered connections, allowing participants to bond over shared interests, learn from each other, and grow together.
The final round? That was the pinnacle. The top 7 teams faced off in a real-life data challenge, applying AI to solve complex, real-world problems. It wasn’t just about the tech—it was about teamwork, creativity, and problem-solving. After the intense 5-hour finale, the top 3 teams shared the prize money, while all teams walked away with unique merchandise as a token of their participation.
But the true prize wasn’t the money or the prizes—it was the friendships formed during those 5 hours. These teams, who once came together as strangers, now continue to collaborate in other competitions, proving that the bonds made here were truly lasting.
We're proud of how this event brought like-minded individuals together and helped forge friendships that will last beyond the competition.
