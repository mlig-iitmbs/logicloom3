From seasoned tech enthusiasts to curious beginners, LogicLooM was designed to push everyone beyond their limits. Round 1 left participants like Debasmit feeling intrigued, while Round 2 took things to a whole new level of difficulty and fun.

As one participant mentioned, "This contest showed me my weak spots and gave me a clear path for improvement."
What truly sets LogicLooM apart is its unique approach to problem-solving. Instead of relying on brute force, the challenges encouraged out-of-the-box thinking. As one participant noted, it was "different from other exams"—a refreshing mental booster. For many, it was a journey that ignited a passion to learn and grow, with one enthusiastic participant requesting, “Please make this event a yearly tradition!"
