With an overwhelming response from our community, we hit a major milestone: over 600 registrations! We managed to stay true to our event’s objectives, delivering an experience that was both impactful and seamless.
Speaking of seamless, the technical execution was a highlight. Our custom-built participant portal worked flawlessly, even with high traffic. The system allowed us to monitor every action, from login to final submission, ensuring that scores were not just accurate, but fair. The portal also included a bulk evaluator, which helped us process complex evaluations in record time—results from Round 1 were ready by 6 AM the next day!
Our participants were also able to track their performance in real-time, accessing detailed summaries of their scores, percentiles, and rankings. This transparency reduced complexity and saved us heaps of time.
A major part of the event’s success was thanks to our distinguished guests. We were honored to host Dr. Jyothi from IIT Gandhinagar, a versatile academic with deep expertise in engineering, mathematics, and education, and Prof. Iyengar from IIT Ropar, a leading figure in computer science education. The highlight of the event was undoubtedly the workshop, which offered participants a chance to dive into the world of Gen AI and ML. With over 200 attendees, it was a packed session full of industry insights and advanced learning.
Looking back, we’re incredibly proud of what we achieved—and we’re excited to bring the same level of success to the next edition of this event. Stay tuned!
